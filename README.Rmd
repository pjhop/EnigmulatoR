## EnigmulatoR

<img src="images/enigmulator.png" width="250" height="300" />

`EnigmulatoR` : R package that emulates the Enigma M3 cipher machine used in WWII.

### Installation

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("pjhop/EnigmulatoR")
```

### Usage

Launch the EnigmulatoR shiny app:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(EnigmulatoR)
EnigmulatoR()
```

The Enigma can also be used in the console, for example:
```{r}
library(EnigmulatoR)
enigma <- Enigma(rotors = c("II", "I", "III"),
                 start_positions = c("D", "E", "F"),
                 ring_settings = c("F", "A", "R"),
                 reflector = "B",
                 plugboard = c(
                   A = "D",
                   C = "Y",
                   F = "Q",
                   G = "R",
                   I = "L",
                   W = "M",
                   Z = "U"
                 )
)

encrypt(enigma, "helloworld")
```
